# This file should contain all the record creation needed to seed the database with its default values.
# The data can then be loaded with the rake db:seed (or created alongside the db with db:setup).
#
# Examples:
#
#   cities = City.create([{ name: 'Chicago' }, { name: 'Copenhagen' }])
#   Mayor.create(name: 'Emanuel', city: cities.first)

# 100.times do
# 	Employee.create(
# 		:first_name => Faker::Name.first_name,
# 		:last_name => Faker::Name.last_name,
# 		:email => Faker::Internet.email,
# 		:birthdate => Faker::Date.backward(50000),
# 		:ssn => Faker::Code.ean
# 		)
# end

200.times do
	Address.create(
		:address_1 => Faker::Address.street_address,
		:address_2 => Faker::Address.secondary_address,
		:city => Faker::Address.city,
		:state => Faker::Address.state,
		:zip => Faker::Address.zip_code,
		:employee_id => rand(1..100)
